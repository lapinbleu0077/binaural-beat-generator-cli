## Binaural Beat Presets

This document explains the purpose and intended use of each predefined binaural beat configuration. Each preset is a unique combination of a carrier frequency and a beat frequency to help entrain the brain to a desired state.

## General Presets

These presets are designed to help you achieve specific mental states and are named after the primary brainwave frequency or state they target.

- **Focus:** A preset for heightened concentration and alertness, typically used for studying or complex problem-solving. It utilizes **Beta brainwaves** (12-30 Hz) which are associated with active thinking.

- **High Focus:** A more intense version of the `Focus` preset, pushing the mind to higher levels of cognitive processing. It leverages **Gamma brainwaves** (30-100 Hz), linked to peak concentration and intelligence.

- **Relaxation:** Promotes a state of calm alertness, ideal for unwinding after a stressful day or for light meditation. This preset uses **Alpha brainwaves** (8-12 Hz).

- **Deep Relaxation:** A deeper state of calm, bridging the gap between wakefulness and sleep. It's often used for deep meditation or to prepare for rest. This preset uses **Theta brainwaves** (4-8 Hz).

- **Sleep:** Designed to induce a state of deep, restorative sleep. It utilizes **Delta brainwaves** (0.5-4 Hz), which are associated with deep, dreamless sleep.
